					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab involved the creation and output of Javascript Arrays and Objects - The main challenge of this lab was the formatting required to properly display the input data.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem that arose was the way in which Arrays and Objects use different types of brackets; While writing the Array, I defined the objects with the usual curved brackets rather than the square ones, which led to errors until the mistake was corrected. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Comparing and contrasting my own code with the examples led to me understanding where and why any issues were occuring. Working through following the examples and researching more detailed info on less transparent functions helped greatly in understanding the mechanics of the lab.</p>
